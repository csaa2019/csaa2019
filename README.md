## Hi! I'm Chloe.

Feel free to check out my repo for some past projects I've worked on. Highlights include:
- Triumvirate Game Arena (triumvirate-2d-game), a 2d local multiplayer battle card game with alternating turn-taking and health/mana systems
- Movie Poster Generator (Project-Site), a project where we trained a DCGAN to generate movie posters and deployed it as a Streamlit app
